## üöÄ Quick Start

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ‚â• v0.18.0.

```sh
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/zola-docs.git

# 2. Change directory into clone
cd zola-docs

# 3. Serve the site locally
zola serve

# 4. Open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) page about installing and using themes.

## üé® Customization

You can change the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the [config.toml](config.toml), and [templates](templates) for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of [config.toml](config.toml) to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit the Zola [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

Adding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to [sass/_custom.scss](sass/_custom.scss). This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.

## üö© Reporting Issues

We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for **Minimal**. Please search [existing issues](https://github.com/semanticdata/zola-minimal/issues). It‚Äôs possible someone has already reported the same problem. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [open a new issue](https://github.com/semanticdata/zola-minimal/issues/new).

## üìù Notes on provided configuration options

These options can be configured in the `extra` section of the [config.toml](config.toml).

- The `easydocs_logo_always_clickable` option controls whether the logo is always clickable, even when on the home page. By default, it is only clickable when not on the home page. If this is enabled, the logo will be clickable on the home page as well, refreshing the page.
- The `easydocs_uglyurls` option provides support for offline sites that do not use a webserver. If set to `true`, links in the nav are generated with the full path including `index.html`. This functionality was inspired by the [Abridge theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/abridge/). Note that for this to work, it also requires the `base_url` to be set to the local folder where the site will be stored, e.g. `base_url = file:///home/user/mysite/public/`. Therefore this is not portable and only works with a specific local folder, but does not require a webserver to navigate the site.
- The `easydocs_heading_threshold` option controls the minimum number of headings needed on a page before headings show in the navigation on the left. The default is 5. This can be used to always show headings on each page by setting it to 1.
